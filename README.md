# popular-movies-app

This project is done according to the rubric specified by Udacity and it makes use of the Retrofit Library and the Room Persistence Library. Moreover it contains both stage 1 and stage 2 of the project.
in order to simplify the performance of the application with minimal overhead.
In this project i made use of card view and recycler view for the grid type layout inorder to enhance performance.

One more important point dont forget to add your api_key of the movie db in the api_key String variable at
app/src/main/java/com/example/nihanth_2/myapplication/Utils/RetrofitUtils.java, as it makes use of the movie db api.

This project is simple to understand and i hope you learn something from this project.

Happy Coding.
